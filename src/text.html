Old Bridge United Methodist Church. We are in the Lake Ridge section of
Woodbridge in an area that is growing in so many ways. Our congregation
is relatively young with lots of children and youth. We are still a
relatively new church. Our main building was built in 1995 and we
recently expanded into another building that will be used for Sunday

classApplestylespan color333333I have been here since the summer of 2004
and I am excited about the future here at Old Bridge. We are striving to
become a very welcoming church where a great diversity of people can
come and enjoy a wonderful time in worship Sunday School Bible Studies
and fellowship. fontbr br font classApplestylespan color333333Our vision
is Together Growing in Christ and we seek to see that statement at work
in every aspect of what we do. We want to grow together in our
relationship to God through Christ and also grow in our relationships
within the congregation. This will mean getting to know one another as
more than just people who sit next to each other in worship. As the body
of Christ here at Old Bridge we will share our common experiences in our
journeys of faith in ways that help us all grow. As we come together to
serve we will see God at work among us and this too will draw us closer
to each other and to God.fontp div styletextalign justifyfont
classApplestylespan color333333 I hope you will take the time to come
and visit with us one Sunday morning. We certainly encourage you to get
involved in at least one of the many opportunities for spiritual growth
and service we have available each and every week. We seek to be a
church where you can feel at home and feel like you are among family. I
invite you to come and inquire further how you can become a part of Old
Bridge United Methodist Church.fontdivdiv styletextalign justifyfont
